Network identity
------------------

When connecting to the network, *{{ApplicationName}}* will use a network identity. (In coming pages, you will create such an identity.) This identity, 
together with its credentials, any public profile you wish to give it, your authorized contacts, and what groups they belong to, will be stored on the 
*broker* you choose. The broker uses this information to help you authorize access to the machine. Make sure this broker handles personal data securely. 
These credentials are also used to gain access to any administrative pages of *{{ApplicationName}}*.
