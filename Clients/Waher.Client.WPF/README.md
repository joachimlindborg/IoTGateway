# Waher.Client.WPF

The **Waher.Client.WPF** project implements a simple IoT client that allows you to interact with things and users. If you connect to the network, you can 
chat with both users and things. The client GUI is built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Chat sessions support normal plain text content, and 
rich content based on markdown. The client also supports multiple connections to different servers.
