# Waher.IoTGateway.Console

The **Waher.IoTGateway.Console** is a console application version of the [IoT Gateway](../Waher.IoTGateway). 
It's easy to use and experiment with. It uses XMPP and can be administered using the 
[Waher.Client.WPF](../Clients/Waher.Client.WPF) application.

When running the application for the first time, you need to configure it. You do this by navigating to it using
a browse. You will be displayed a sequence of dialogs that you need to fill in, to configure different aspects
of the system. This includes setting up the connection to the XMPP network.

The [Waher.IoTGateway.Svc](../Waher.IoTGateway.Svc) project provides a Windows Service for the **IoT Gateway**.

## Web Server

The **IoT Gateway** contains an integrated web server. It can be used to host any web content under the `Root` folder. 
[Markdown](../Content/Waher.Content.Markdown/README.md) content (files with extensions `.md` or `.markdown`) will 
automatically be converted to HTML if viewed by a browser. To retrieve the markdown file as-is, make sure the `HTTP GET` method includes 
`Accept: text/markdown` in its header.

### Using standard HTTP ports

If you want to allow the gateway to have access to the HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports, you might need to 
[disable any web server or service running on the machine](http://www.devside.net/wamp-server/opening-up-port-80-for-apache-to-use-on-windows),
or tell them to use different ports. This includes the HTTP Server API, (http.sys), if it is running on the machine, or any other application that 
has these ports open, like Skype. 

If running the application under Linux, you also need administrative privileges when you execute the application, to it to be able to open these ports.

>	On my Windows 8.1 machine, the following, taken from the article above, entred into a command prompt having administrator
>	privileges, and then restarting the machine, shut down the `http.sys` service.
>
>		net stop http /y
>		sc config http start= disabled
>
>	I also had to manually configure Skype to not use HTTP and HTTPS ports for incoming calls.

**Note**: If using the [IoT Gateway installer](../Executables/IoTGatewaySetip.exe) to install the application, the
above is done as part of the installation. 

## Console interface

It also outputs any events and network communication to the console, to facilitate implementation of IoT interfaces.

## Pluggable modules.

The IoT Gateway supports pluggable modules. All modules found in the binary folder of the gateway are loaded at startup. Each class 
implementing the `Waher.Script.IModule` interface will be informed correspondingly when the server is started and stopped. The
`Waher.Script.Types` class contains static methods for accessing *module parameters*. These are used to pass information from the server
to each module. There are different module parameters defined by the IoT Gateway:

| Name           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `AppData`      | Where the **IoT Gateway** application data folder is situated. |
| `CoAP`         | `CoapEndpoint` object managing the local CoAP endpoint of the gateway, as well as acting CoAP client for accessing CoAP devices. |
| `Control`      | `ControlServer` object, publishing a XMPP IoT Control Server interface on the XMPP network. |
| `Concentrator` | `ConcentratorServer` object, publishing a XMPP IoT Concentrator Server interface on the XMPP network. |
| `HTTP`         | `HttpServer` object hosting the web server. |
| `HTTPX`        | `HttpxProxy` object providing `httpx` support to web clients. |
| `HTTPXS`       | `HttpxServer` object providing `httpx` support to web servers. |
| `IBB`          | `IbbClient` object providing In-band Bytestream support to the XMPP connection. |
| `Root`         | Where the **IoT Gateway** web folder is situated. All content in this folder, including subfolders, is accessible through the web interface. |
| `Sensor`       | `SensorServer` object, publishing a XMPP IoT Sensor Server interface on the XMPP network. |
| `SOCKS5`       | `Socks5Proxy` object managing SOCKS5 stream negotiations over XMPP. |
| `XMPP`         | `XmppClient` object managing the XMPP connection of the gateway. |

## Object database

The IoT Gateway hosts an encrypted object database based on the `Waher.Persistence.Files` library, via interfaces provided by the
`Waher.Persistence` library. It can be replaced by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center), by using the `Waher.Persistence.MongoDB`
library instead. Since all interaction with the object database goes through `Waher.Persistence`, it is easy to port the gateway to other object 
database providers, without having to update code in all pluggable modules.

## Binary executable

You can test the application by downloading and installing the IoT Gateway using the [IoT Gateway installer](../Executables/IoTGatewaySetup.exe).
